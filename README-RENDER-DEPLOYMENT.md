# Render.com Deployment Guide

This is a complete deployment package for the Parts Catalogue System on Render.com.

## Quick Deployment Steps

1. **Upload this entire folder** to your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)

2. **Connect to Render.com:**
   - Go to https://render.com
   - Sign up/Sign in
   - Click "New +" → "Static Site"
   - Connect your repository

3. **Configure the service:**
   - **Build Command:** `npm install -g pnpm@8.15.6 && pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm run build`
   - **Publish Directory:** `dist`
   - **Node Version:** 20

4. **Deploy:** Click "Create Static Site"

## Alternative: Using render.yaml (Recommended, auto-static config)

If your repository has the `render.yaml` file (included in this package), Render will automatically use the configuration:

- Build Command: `npm install -g pnpm@8.15.6 && pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile && pnpm run build`
- Static Publish Path: `dist`
- Node Version: 20
- PNPM Version: 8.15.6

## Important Notes

## Support

If you encounter any issues during deployment, check:
1. Repository is properly connected
2. Node version is set to 20
3. Build command matches exactly as specified
4. Publish directory is set to `dist`

Deploy with confidence! 🚀

## Why Static Site (Not Web Service)

This project is built by Vite into static files in `dist`, so Render should deploy it as a **Static Site** instead of a Web Service.
Using Web Service can cause runtime/build confusion (for example `vite: command not found` if devDependencies are skipped).
